Expanded Stellaris Traditions 2 - The Sequel
Updated by MrWacko
Originally created by Girion

Features
- 44 new tradition trees added.
- Extensive use of tradition swapping.
- Playing a hive-mind, or an authoritarian dictatorship? In that case, liberal democracy style traditions will be swapped out for more fitting stuff (what exactly depends on what you play).
- Not using Robots? Traditions giving bonuses to robots will give different bonuses. Same things for slavery, megastructures etc.
- Theme changing with your empire. The Order tree will be very different for a Slaving Autocracy and an Egalitan empire.
- Built-in AI support. Either the AI is able to use a tradition properly, or they will have an easier-to-use swap giving a corresponding bonus.
- Traditions do not only contains passive bonuses, more interesting effects, such as:
- Bonuses depending on your playstyle, conditioned on fulfilling special conditions.
- Adding new buildings, edicts, jobs, policies, technologies, traits, etc.
- Gain resources for destroying enemy ships, raid neighbouring empires, pick virtues for your leaders, and much more interesting stuff.
- Unique icons, tree layouts, and well-written flavour texts for all traditions.
- Full compatibility with other mods.

Bug Reports

- Please report all bugs that you find. However, it would be very helpful if you could follow these steps to make it easier for me to fix the bug:
    - Please describe what is the problem. "X doesn't work" is not very helpful.
    - Please provide a screenshot, it is very helpful.
    - Please try and confirm whenever the bug persists with only this mod present.
    - Please describe any steps you can take to reproduce the bug.

Girion
- Maker of the original Expanded Stellaris Traditions. Sadly they are no longer maintaining original, hence me posting an update. This mod is theirs, I am simply a caretaker.

Birdy (Maker of the Plentiful Traditions Mod). Quite a few things in this mod are inspired by their work.
- The theme of the Malice tree is their idea (but the content my own).
- I renamed my biogenesis and faith trees to use Birdy's, better, names.
- They came up with the idea to "collapse" the discovery tree to gain space.
- They figured out how to make the scrollbar so you could fit more traditions in, I used that idea as well.
- (There are a few more cases where we have traditions with the same name, these are coincidence)

Maethydd
- The tradition version of the old ethics Individualism/Collectivism traditions was first introduced in their tradition mod.

Rokhmal
- Have written a lot of very nice traditions descriptions for the mod.
